          I've built this app using ReactJS to provide you with a smooth and interactive experience. The app features a simple calculator to help you with your basic arithmetic needs. Whether you're calculating expenses or trying to solve a math problem, this calculator is here to help. In addition to the calculator, my app has a page dedicated to displaying a random quote. Each time you visit this page, you'll be greeted with a new quote to inspire and motivate you.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          To make navigation as easy as possible, I've implemented React Router for routing. This means you can seamlessly move between different pages of the app without any hiccups. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone looking for a quick and easy way to do basic calculations and get inspired, my web application is here to help. Thank you for checking it out and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it!
